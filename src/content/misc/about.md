Hi! I'm Choco, a software engineer passionate about building innovative web applications and tools. With a strong focus on modern technologies and user experience, I specialize in creating scalable solutions that make a difference.

Currently, I'm working on VTubersTV, a comprehensive platform for VTuber content and community engagement. I'm also developing Flux, a modern shell written in Rust, and maintaining several open-source projects including Orbit, a feature-rich Discord bot.

My tech journey spans across multiple domains:
- Full-stack web development with TypeScript, Nuxt.js, and modern frameworks
- Systems programming with Rust and C
- Cloud infrastructure and deployment
- Bot development and automation
- UI/UX design and implementation

When I'm not coding, I'm either contributing to open-source projects, exploring new technologies, or engaging with the developer community. I'm particularly interested in:
- Building efficient and scalable applications
- Creating intuitive user interfaces
- Developing tools that enhance developer productivity
- Contributing to the open-source community

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and creating software that not only works well but is also enjoyable to use. Whether it's a web application, a command-line tool, or a Discord bot, I strive to deliver high-quality solutions that meet real needs.

Feel free to check out my projects or reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
