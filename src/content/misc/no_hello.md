title: No Hello
---

# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

If you're reading this, you probably want to get in touch with me. That's great! However, to make our communication as efficient and productive as possible, I kindly ask you to follow these guidelines.

## Why "No Hello"?

Sending just "Hello" or "Hi" without context forces me to wait for you to explain why you're reaching out. This creates unnecessary back-and-forth and delays. Instead, get straight to the point so I can help you faster!

## How to Message Me

1. Don't:
    - "Hello"
    - "Hi Stella"
    - "Are you there?"
    - *[Insert vague greeting here]*
2. Do:
    - Start with a clear and concise message that includes:
        - **What you need**: Describe your request or question.
        - **Why you're reaching out**: Provide context.
        - **Any relevant links or attachments**: If applicable.

Example:

> "Hi Stella, Iâ€™m working on [project] and need your input on [specific detail]. Hereâ€™s a link to the document: [link]. Let me know if you need more info!"

## Preferred Communication Channels

- **Email**: [hello@choco.rip](mailto:hello@choco.rip), [choco@choco.rip](mailto:choco@choco.rip)
- **Socials**: [https://choco.rip/about](https://choco.rip/about)
- **Time Zone**: JST (Japan Standard Time)

Please keep in mind that Iâ€™m in JST, so responses may be delayed if youâ€™re in a different time zone.

## Why This Matters

Efficient communication saves time for both of us and ensures I can address your needs promptly. By skipping the small talk and getting straight to the point, we can focus on what really matters.
