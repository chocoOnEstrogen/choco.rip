title: No Hello
---

# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

If you're reading this, you probably want to get in touch with me. That's great! However, to make our communication as efficient and productive as possible, I kindly ask you to follow these guidelines.

## Why "No Hello"?

Sending just "Hello" or "Hi" without context forces me to wait for you to explain why you're reaching out. This creates unnecessary back-and-forth and delays. Instead, get straight to the point so I can help you faster!

## How to Message Me

1. Don't:
    - "Hello"
    - "Hi Stella"
    - "Are you there?"
    - *[Insert vague greeting here]*
2. Do:
    - Start with a clear and concise message that includes:
        - **What you need**: Describe your request or question.
        - **Why you're reaching out**: Provide context.
        - **Any relevant links or attachments**: If applicable.

Example:

> "Hi Stella, Iâ€™m working on [project] and need your input on [specific detail]. Hereâ€™s a link to the document: [link]. Let me know if you need more info!"

## Contact Information & Availability

- **Primary Email**: [hello@choco.rip](mailto:hello@choco.rip)
- **Secondary Email**: [choco@choco.rip](mailto:choco@choco.rip) 
- **Social Profiles**: [choco.rip/about](https://choco.rip/about)
- **Time Zone**: Eastern Time (ET/UTC-5)

I aim to respond within 24-48 business hours. Due to time zone differences, responses may be delayed for contacts outside of Eastern Time. For urgent matters, please indicate the time-sensitivity in your message.

## Why This Matters

Efficient communication saves time for both of us and ensures I can address your needs promptly. By skipping the small talk and getting straight to the point, we can focus on what really matters.
