# Supporting Our Trans Community

I'm excited to announce the launch of our new [transgender resources page](/trans-help)! As a trans woman myself, I understand how crucial it is to have access to reliable information and support services. This page aims to be a comprehensive collection of resources for the transgender community, from crisis support to healthcare information.

## Why This Matters

Finding reliable transgender resources can be challenging and overwhelming. Many of us struggle to find:
- Trustworthy healthcare providers
- Mental health support
- Legal assistance
- Community connections

This page aims to address these needs by providing a carefully curated collection of resources, all in one accessible location.

## Current Features

The resource page includes several key sections:
- 24/7 Crisis Support
- Mental Health Resources
- Medical Resources
- Legal Resources
- Community Support
- Educational Materials
- DIY Resources (with appropriate safety warnings)
