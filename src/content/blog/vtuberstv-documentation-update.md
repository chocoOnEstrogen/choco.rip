# Major Documentation Update: New Governance and Structure

Today marks a significant milestone in VTubersTV's development with the release of comprehensive documentation that outlines our governance structure, moderation systems, and technical guidelines. This update represents our commitment to transparency and community-driven development.

## New Governance Structure

The newly added governance documentation establishes a clear framework for decision-making and project leadership. Key highlights include:

### Core Team Structure
- A small group of 3-5 trusted maintainers
- Project leadership under [@Stella](https://github.com/chocoOnEstrogen)
- Merit-based selection process for team members

### Decision Making Process
- Transparent, community-involved decision making
- Clear distinction between day-to-day and major decisions
- Required community input periods for significant changes

## Meritocratic Advancement

We've implemented a clear path for community members to grow within the project:

1. First-time Contributors
2. Regular Contributors
3. Core Team Candidates

Each level has specific responsibilities and requirements, ensuring a fair and transparent advancement process.

## Technical Documentation

The update includes detailed technical guidelines covering:

- Streaming quality optimization
- Model performance recommendations
- Network infrastructure requirements
- Hardware usage guidelines

## Community Participation

We've established multiple channels for community involvement:

- GitHub Issues and Discussions
- Project Discord/Slack
- Monthly community calls
- Quarterly roadmap reviews

## Documentation Standards

All major decisions will now be documented using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), stored in the `/documents/decisions` directory. This ensures our decision-making process remains transparent and well-documented for future reference.

## Looking Forward

These documentation updates represent our commitment to building a sustainable, community-driven platform. As we continue to grow, these guidelines will help ensure VTubersTV remains true to its open-source values while providing clear pathways for community participation and leadership.
